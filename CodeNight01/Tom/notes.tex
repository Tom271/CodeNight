\section{Done:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coded up F-H model, plot phase plane using ODE45. 
	\item Turned it into VDP model for simplicity
	\item Plotted graphs of max amplitude against bifurcation parameter
	\item Ran using \texttt{parfor} to speed up 100 runs, seems deterministic -- no variety in output. True behaviour or quirk of ODE solver?
	\item Tweaked parameters playing with behaviour, seemed to have got canard/behaviour switching.
\end{itemize}
\section{What's Good?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Found a range where canards can happen.
	\item Found multiple behaviours at one point.
\end{itemize}
\section{What Next?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Look at stochastic models as intended.
	\item Write own ODE solver.
	\item Work out whether system should be deterministic or not. How can there be randomness in a deterministic system?
	\item Read more into F-N model for intuition.
\end{itemize}
