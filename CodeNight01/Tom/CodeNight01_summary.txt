What I've Done:
    - Coded up F-H model, plot phase plane using ODE45. 
    - Turned it into VDP model for` simplicity
    - Plotted graphs of max amplitude against bifurcation parameter
    - Ran using parfor to speed up 100 runs, seems deterministic -- no variety in output. True behaviour or quirk of ODE solver?
    - Tweaked parameters playing with behaviour, seemed to have got canard/behaviour switching.

What I'm Proud Of:
    - Found a range where canards occur
    - Found multiple behaviours at one point

What Next?:
    - Actually do the project I wanted to - stochastic models
    - Write my own ODE solver to add noise in
    - Work out whether system should be deterministic or not. How can there be randomness in a deterministic system?
