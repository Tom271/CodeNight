What I've done:
- Return pageviews for pages in wikipedia
  - can be any page but I'm looking at FTSE 100 companies
  - can plot multiple pageviews
- Return historic price data for FTSE 100 Companies

What I'm proud of:
- Used two APIs with no major faults, had no huge technical problems in this project
- My volume of output: 200 lines of code in 4 hours, ~10 functions

What to do looking ahead:
- Code clean up
- Match up stock prices and wiki page views over specific date ranges
- Run some kind of statistical correlation
